### Minor Changes

- f79976c: **@northware/ui@0.1.0 is a preview-version to be worked on with the progress of the monorepo.**

  Northware UI (@northware/ui) is a component library shareable through the Northware Monorepo.
  It uses Components from **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** based on [Radix UI Premitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
  The package `@northware/ui` provides the `general.css` file to be used in every Northware App and a set of components as well as shareable functions and hooks to define the UI.
