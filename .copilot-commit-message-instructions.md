# Instructions for Commit Messages to be used by GitHub Copilot

- Use conventional commits
- Follow the configuration in `commitlint.config.ts`
- Only use the types allowed by Commitlint:
  - Use "feat" for new features
  - Use "fix" for bug fixes
  - Use "docs" for documentation content changes (apps/docs). If changes are made to the Docusaurus app that do not affect the documentation content, use another type
  - Use "chore" for small changes that do not fit into other categories
  - Use "revert" for reverting a commit or a large change
- Use the package or app name as the scope. Use the package name without "northware-" or "@northware/". If changes are made to two packages or apps, use both names as the scope, separated by a "/". If more packages or apps are involved, use the scope "mixed". If changes are made exclusively to files in the root directory, use the scope "root". If changes are made to files in .github, use the scope "github-management".
- Use English for the subject.
- Use German for the body. Prefer bullet points over continuous text.
- Reference closed or related issues, pull requests, and/or commits in the footer, using the correct GitHub keywords.
