# Northware Docs

This is the Code for the Documentation of the Northware Suite. Its purpose is to help along the development process of the apps, to document the code itself and to explain Northware to end-users.

This documentation uses [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev/) and is available at [northware-docs.netlify.app](https://northware-docs.netlify.app).
